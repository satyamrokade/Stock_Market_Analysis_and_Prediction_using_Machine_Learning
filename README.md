# _Stock_Market_Analysis_and_Prediction_using_Machine_Learning

In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning model that predicts stock prices based on historical data. Leveraging machine learning techniques, particularly time series analysis and deep learning, we will create a model that learns patterns and trends from historical stock data and uses them to forecast future stock prices.
